            Grapeshave been part of the human diet for centuries. They are easy to grow and are ideal for winemaking. The fruit may also be dried and preserved as raisins.

            Grape juice is made from the whole grape, including the skin, flesh, and seeds. It contains most of the vitamins and minerals found in table grapes, plus the health benefits of the nutrient-rich seeds.
            
            The most common type of grape juice is purple and is made using Concord grapes. You can also find white grape juice that is made from Niagara grapes. Both types of grapes are native to America.
            
            Eating whole grapes is also a great choice. The fresh fruit provides fiber and additional vitamins.

                            <li>Rinse the organic black grapes or green grapes thoroughly in water a few times using a mesh strainer or colander. Drain all the water and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the rinsed grapes to a blender. Blend to a fine consistency ensuring there are no chunks of the grapes. Pour the juice on a strainer which has been lined under a bowl.</li>
                            <li>With a spoon press the pulp in the strainer very well, so that all the extra juice is strained.</li>
                            <li>Taste the juice and if it feels strong for your palate, add some water as needed.</li>
                            <li>If the juice is not sweet, add some sugar or your preferred sweetener.</li>
                            <li>For a bit of tang, add lemon juice. Stir to mix. Pour grape juice in glasses or mugs.</li>
                            <li>While serving the juice, sprinkle a pinch of black salt in the glasses if you like.</li>
                            <li>Serve Black Grape Juice immediately with or without ice cubes.</li>
                            <li>You can garnish the juice with grapes or mint leaves.</li>
