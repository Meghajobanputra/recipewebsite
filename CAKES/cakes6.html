    <i>
   <p>This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree and strawberry gelatin. This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a caterer. I made this cake for a child's birthday party and it was a major hit! Frost with cream cheese frosting or chocolate ganache for a special treat.</p>

                        <ol >
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
                        <li>Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                        <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk.</li>
                        <li>Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla.</li>  
                        <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
                        <li> serve and Enjoy!</li>

                                        <ol>
                                          <li>Use high-quality ingredients, especially for the chocolate, cherries, and whipped cream, as they significantly impact the final taste of the Black Forest Cake.  </li>
                                          <li>Accurate measurements are crucial for baking. Use measuring cups and spoons to ensure you add the right amount of each ingredient.</li>
                                          <li>When incorporating dry ingredients into the batter, gently fold them in using a spatula. Avoid overmixing to maintain a light and fluffy texture.</li>
                                          <li>Allow the cake layers to cool completely before assembling and frosting. This prevents the frosting from melting and ensures a stable structure.</li>
                                          <li>Use chilled cream and a cold mixing bowl to whip the cream.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <h2>Taste:  Sweet and chocolaty with soft and moist texture. </h2>
                                        <h3> Serving Ideas: </h3>
                                        <p> Serve it as a dessert after dinner or make it for the kid’s birthday party. Enjoy it with vanilla ice-cream or on its own.</p>
