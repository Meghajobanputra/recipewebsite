            Indulge in the divine delight of homemade eggless Black Forest Cake with our easy recipe.

The cake prepared with Nestlé MILKMAID is rich, moist, and luscious, and offers an unmatchable melt-in-the-mouth texture. And then, you bite into cherries, and their tartness cuts through the sweetness, creating this amazing balance of flavours. And let's not forget the whipped cream—it's light and airy, adding a creamy touch that makes each bite memorable.

                         <li>Grease an 8” diameter baking tin and dust it with flour. </li>
                         <li>Pre heat the oven at 180o C. Sieve together maida, cocoa powder, baking powder and soda bicarbonate (sieve 2-3 times for better aeration).</li>

                                        <ol>
                                          <li>Use high-quality ingredients, especially for the chocolate, cherries, and whipped cream, as they significantly impact the final taste of the Black Forest Cake.  </li>
                                          <li>Accurate measurements are crucial for baking. Use measuring cups and spoons to ensure you add the right amount of each ingredient.</li>
                                          <li>When incorporating dry ingredients into the batter, gently fold them in using a spatula. Avoid overmixing to maintain a light and fluffy texture.</li>
                                          <li>Allow the cake layers to cool completely before assembling and frosting. This prevents the frosting from melting and ensures a stable structure.</li>
                                          <li>Use chilled cream and a cold mixing bowl to whip the cream.</li>
                                        </ol>
