                        <ol>
                        <li>Dissolve custard powder in 2 tablespoons milk. Transfer remaining milk into the pan, add sugar and bring it to boil over medium flame. When it starts to boil, add milk-custard powder mixture and stir constantly with a spoon and cook until raw smell of custard powder goes away; it will take around 5-7 minutes. Turn off the flame and pour milk into a large bowl. Let it cool down to room temperature and then place it in the refrigerator to chill for 1-hour.</li>
                        <li>Grocery stores carry two types of falooda sev (corn vermicelli); yellow and white. You can use any one of it based on the availability and your preference.</li>
                        <li>Cook the falooda sev according to the instructions given on the package or follow the step-2 and 3 given below.</li>
                        <li>
                            Boil approx. 2-3 cups of water in a deep pan over medium flame. When it comes to rolling boil, add approx. 1/3 cup falooda sev and cook until it turns soft. It will take around 4-5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Transfer cooked sev to a fine mesh strainer (or a sieve) and drain excess water. Pour 1 cup of cold water over it and drain it to stop further cooking.</li>
                            <li>Soak 2 teaspoons sabja seeds in 3/4 cup water for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, transfer them to a sieve and drain the water.</li>
                            <li>Assemble all ingredients required to make the falooda. We have used the fresh mango puree to enhance the flavor. However, you can use canned mango puree as its replacement.</li>
                            <li>
                                Take two serving glasses. Add 1-tablespoon sabja seeds and 2 tablespoons mango puree in each glass.</li>
                                <li>Add 2-tablespoons falooda sev and again add 1-tablespoon sabja seeds.</li>
                                <li>Add 2-tablespoons mango puree, 2-tablespoon mango cubes and pour 1/2 cup milk prepared in step-1 in each glass.</li>
                                <li>Add a scoop of ice cream and garnish with dry-fruits.</li>
